Open Space
An Interactive Fiction by Thalie Schmidt, Laura Pippus, David Pavlik et Ludovic Rochat
Release 1 / Serial number 210510 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

The office
Your boss and yourself are in the midst of stormy negotiations with new potential associates. The atmosphere is tense, so much so that you can feel sweat beads dripping down your tailored shirt as your sticky hands pound on your laptop keyboard. Your boss sits at your left while two other gentlemen sit straight across from you both. All of you have been in here, bargaining over contract terms, for quite a while now and you wrists are staring to ache as you write and erase what the others tell you to. The shadows you cast on the white office walls gently shift as the sun goes down,  you wish they had come up to an agreement by now.

Suddenly, either out of weariness or out of boldness, one of your guests leans in towards you and suggests a daring idea. You see a spark light up everybody else's as the idea sinks a little deeper in all of your minds.

-This is great ..! says your boss.

- This is illegal. you respond. Completely astonished by the nature of such suggestions.

- You're right, this can't appear on the records. Put that computer aside and grab a piece of paper! he adds.

You look around but can't seem to find any paper laying around. New ideas flood the room and you are not able the write any of them down. You painfully interrupt this flow of thoughts:

-Sir, I don't think we have any paper nor any pens. The bubbly brainstorm turns into three heavy stairs, the kind of stairs that strip you from your will to disagree.

- Would you be so kind as to go and fetch some for us ? asks the scarier of the two guest.

-Yes, of course. you respond as you quickly get up. 

You can see a big door, a Leather chair and a conference table here.

Scientific Base Camp
The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the entrance tunnel.

You can see an entrance tunnel here.

Igloo
You cannot see much, but a dying fire sufficiently illuminates the place to be able to see the room made of ice. At the back of the igloo, you see a sleeping person. He looks like a researcher, he certainly writes things down everyday...

You can see an entrance tunnel and a sleeping researcher here.

-Yes, of course. you respond as you quickly get up. 

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

You can also see a big door here.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Office
Your boss and yourself are in the midst of stormy negotiations with new potential associates. The atmosphere is tense, so much so that you can feel sweat beads dripping down your tailored shirt as your sticky hands pound on your laptop keyboard. Your boss sits at your left while two other gentlemen sit straight across from you both. All of you have been in here, bargaining over contract terms, for quite a while now and you wrists are staring to ache as you write and erase what the others tell you to. The shadows you cast on the white office walls gently shift as the sun goes down,  you wish they had come up to an agreement by now.

Suddenly, either out of weariness or out of boldness, one of your guests leans in towards you and suggests a daring idea. You see a spark light up everybody else's as the idea sinks a little deeper in all of your minds.

-This is great ..! says your boss.

- This is illegal. you respond. Completely astonished by the nature of such suggestions.

- You're right, this can't appear on the records. Put that computer aside and grab a piece of paper! he adds.

You look around but can't seem to find any paper laying around. New ideas flood the room and you are not able the write any of them down. You painfully interrupt this flow of thoughts:

-Sir, I don't think we have any paper nor any pens. The bubbly brainstorm turns into three heavy stairs, the kind of stairs that strip you from your will to disagree.

- Would you be so kind as to go and fetch some for us ? asks the scarier of the two guest.

-Yes, of course. you respond as you quickly get up. 

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

You can also see a big door here.

an old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

Chinese Workshop
A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him:

- Sir, may I borrow one of these please?

- Yes, of course, go ahead.

Maharaja's palace
The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around.

Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

You can see a Peacock here.

Druid's tent
an old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

Alexandria's Library
This is probably the greatest sanctuary of knowledge of all time. There are tons of books in there. They don't seem to be arranged in any specific order. You realize just how much looking up stuff was an elephantine task before the Internet.

Blizzard
Leave this place, you are in a primitive icy storm. The wind pierces your clothes and shut your eyes closed. You don't want to spend too much time in here. As you are reading this, your toes are getting frozen and threatens to fall. With your office clothes, you don't stand a chance. If you stay here few more seconds, you'll never see your beloved office again.

As you are not an athlete, this operation is proving very difficult; but you manage to pull yourself up.

Ritual Waste
This place reminds you why you dont like BBQ: mostly because of the smell... While you are wondering why you got up here, your eyes are caught by what seems to be a human collarbone. It is strangely sharp, it almost look like a pen..

Aztec Temple
The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

Aztec Temple
The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

The only community still standing in 20900"s India. This sanctuary is filled with trees, and in the network of streams that run around, you can see huge red, orange and white carps.

Maharaja's palace
The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around.

Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

You can see a Peacock here.

Druid's tent
an old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

Blizzard
Leave this place, you are in a primitive icy storm. The wind pierces your clothes and shut your eyes closed. You don't want to spend too much time in here. As you are reading this, your toes are getting frozen and threatens to fall. With your office clothes, you don't stand a chance. If you stay here few more seconds, you'll never see your beloved office again.

Aztec temple
The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

Chinese Workshop
A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him:

- Sir, may I borrow one of these please?

- Yes, of course, go ahead.

Maharaja's palace
The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around.

Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

You can see a Peacock here.

Druid's tent
an old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

New Delhi
You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers in the spring, birds are singing and market sellers seems to be answering them prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuk, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones.

Scientific Base Camp
Present of Antarctica. The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the tunnel.

You can see a tunnel here.

Druid's tent
an old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

Blizzard
Leave this place, you are in a primitive icy storm. The wind pierces your clothes and shut your eyes closed. You don't want to spend too much time in here. As you are reading this, your toes are getting frozen and threatens to fall. With your office clothes, you don't stand a chance. If you stay here few more seconds, you'll never see your beloved office again.

Gunshots pierce the sky as you cross the road of today's Mexico. It is getting quite dark and you don't want any trouble. You see four similarly unwellcoming alleyways each leading in different directions: south, north, east and west.

Aztec temple
The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

Chinese Workshop
A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him:

- Sir, may I borrow one of these please?

- Yes, of course, go ahead.

Maharaja's palace
The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around.

Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

You can see a Peacock here.

Druid's tent
an old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.
