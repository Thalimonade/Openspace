Open Space
An Interactive Fiction by Thalie Schmidt, Laura Pippus, David Pavlik et Ludovic Rochat
Release 1 / Serial number 210515 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

The office
Your boss and yourself are in the midst of stormy negotiations with new potential associates. The atmosphere is tense, so much so that you can feel sweat beads dripping down your tailored shirt as your sticky hands pound on your laptop keyboard. Your boss sits at your left while two other gentlemen sit straight across from you both. All of you have been in here, bargaining over contract terms, for quite a while now and you wrists are staring to ache as you write and erase what the others tell you to. The shadows you cast on the white office walls gently shift as the sun goes down,  you wish they had come up to an agreement by now. Suddenly, either out of weariness or out of boldness, one of your guests leans in towards you and suggests a daring idea. You see a spark light up everybody else's as the idea sinks a little deeper in all of your minds. -This is great ..! says your boss. - This is illegal. you respond. Completely astonished by the nature of such suggestions. - You're right, this can't appear on the records. Put that computer aside and grab a piece of paper! he adds. You look around but can't seem to find any paper laying around. New ideas flood the room and you are not able the write any of them down. You painfully interrupt this flow of thoughts: -Sir, I don't think we have any paper nor any pens. The bubbly brainstorm turns into three heavy stairs, the kind of stairs that strip you from your will to disagree. - Would you be so kind as to go and fetch some for us ? asks the scarier of the two guest. -Yes, of course. you respond as you quickly get up. 

You can see a big door, a Leather chair and a conference table here.

Scientific Base Camp
Present of Antarctica. The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the tunnel.

You can see a tunnel here.

New Delhi
In the future is Yogi's retreat and in the past is Maharaja's palace. You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers in the spring, birds are singing and market sellers seems to be answering them prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuk, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones.

office
- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

Shouldn't you bring back a pen?
Shouldn't you bring back a paper?

This workshop is A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these papers please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

You can see a Black Jack (in which is a hidden pistol) here.

Wuhan
In the future is a Futuristic Casino and in the past is a Chinese Workshop.
A new, deadly virus was detected for the first time here. The city center is deserted, while the hospitals and morgues are filled with covid patients. You don't have a mask, you not even have a scarf to put around your mouth and nose... it might be better to leave Wuhan as fast as possible!!

Chinese Workshop
In the future is Wuhan.
This workshop is A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these papers please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

New Delhi
In the future is Yogi's retreat and in the past is Maharaja's palace. You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers in the spring, birds are singing and market sellers seems to be answering them prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuk, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones.

office
- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

In the future is the city center of New Delhi. The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around. Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

office
- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

Wuhan
In the future is a Futuristic Casino and in the past is a Chinese Workshop.
A new, deadly virus was detected for the first time here. The city center is deserted, while the hospitals and morgues are filled with covid patients. You don't have a mask, you not even have a scarf to put around your mouth and nose... it might be better to leave Wuhan as fast as possible!!

You can see a virus here.

New Delhi
In the future is Yogi's retreat and in the past is Maharaja's palace. You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers in the spring, birds are singing and market sellers seems to be answering them prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuk, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones.

Futuristic Casino
In the past, Wuhan was here. But now, a milion colorful and blinking neon lights iluminate the corridors, and a pathway covered in a fluffy carpet leads you to the Black Jack table. A robot serves you a sparkling drink as the crowd gathered around Black Jack table cheers. You overhear a conversation and it seems like the winner gets a pistol, which could be very useful in opening doors... Since you are here, you might want to try your luck playing the Black Jack. 

You can see a Black Jack table (in which is a pistol) here.
