Open Space
An Interactive Fiction by Thalie Schmidt, Laura Pippus, David Pavlik et Ludovic Rochat
Release 1 / Serial number 210509 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Office
Your boss and yourself are in the midst of stormy negotiations with new potential associates. The atmosphere is tense, so much so that you can feel sweat beads dripping down your tailored shirt as your sticky hands pound on your laptop keyboard. Your boss sits at your left while two other gentlemen sit straight across from you both. All of you have been in here, bargaining over contract terms, for quite a while now and you wrists are staring to ache as you write and erase what the others tell you to. The shadows you cast on the white office walls gently shift as the sun goes down,  you wish they had come up to an agreement by now.

Suddenly, either out of weariness or out of boldness, one of your guests leans in towards you and suggests a daring idea. You see a spark light up everybody else's as the idea sinks a little deeper in all of your minds.

-This is great ..! says your boss.

- This is illegal. you respond. Completely astonished by the nature of such suggestions.

- You're right, this can't appear on the records. Put that computer aside and grab a piece of paper! he adds.

You look around but can't seem to find any paper laying around. New ideas flood the room and you are not able the write any of them down. Your painfully interrupt this flow thoughts:

-Sir, I don't think we have any paper nor any pens. The bubbly brainstorm turns into three heavy stairs, the kind of stairs that strip you from your will to disagree.

- Would you be so kind as to go and fetch some for us ? asks the scarier of the two guest.

-Yes, of course. you respond as you quickly get up. 

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

You can also see a big door here.

Scientific Base Camp
The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the entrance tunnel.

You can see an entrance tunnel here.

Igloo
You cannot see much, but a dying fire sufficiently illuminates the place to be able to see the room made of ice. At the back of the igloo, you see a sleeping person. He looks like a researcher, he certainly writes things down everyday...

You can see an entrance tunnel and a sleeping researcher here.

There are poorly lit openings in the trees leading either to the north or the south.

You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers in the spring, birds are singing and market sellers seems to be answering them prices of their marchandises, the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuk that add a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones.

A new, deadly virus was detected for the first time here. The city center is deserted, while the hospitals and morgues are filled with covid patients. You don't have a mask, you not even have a scarf to put around your mouth and nose... it might be better to leave Wuhan as fast as possible!!

Igloo
You cannot see much, but a dying fire sufficiently illuminates the place to be able to see the room made of ice. At the back of the igloo, you see a sleeping person. He looks like a researcher, he certainly writes things down everyday...

Scientific Base Camp
Present of Antarctica. The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the tunnel.

You can see a tunnel here.

Scorpion World
Here you step into the future of Latin America. As time passed, a lot of species went extinct. Not scorpions though, scorpions got bigger. Unfortunately, way bigger than you. The whole contient mutated into a huge conurbation of enormous scorpion nests: you are in the middle of it. In front of you is one of those scorpion nest.

The nest is swarming with "little" scorpions, as big as your head. One of the baby scorpion - that you surprisingly find cute with its sharp little claws, its hairy exoskeleton and its menacing scorpion's tail dancing gently in the warm wind - comes to you, certainly interested by your delicious monkey shape. Violence is never an answer - but now that you are in front of the scorpion that keeps coming closer, saliva dripping from its lips, I would suggest you to attack it!"

The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

Maharaja's palace
The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around.

Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

You can see a Peacock here.

You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers in the spring, birds are singing and market sellers seems to be answering them prices of their marchandises, the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuk that add a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones.

The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the entrance tunnel.

You can see an entrance tunnel here.

A new, deadly virus was detected for the first time here. The city center is deserted, while the hospitals and morgues are filled with covid patients. You don't have a mask, you not even have a scarf to put around your mouth and nose... it might be better to leave Wuhan as fast as possible!!

Mexico City
Gunshots pierce the sky as you cross the road of today's Mexico. It is getting quite dark and you don't want any trouble. You see four similarly unwellcoming alleyways each leading in different directions: south, north, east and west.

Scorpion World
Here you step into the future of Latin America. As time past, a lot of species went extinct. Not scorpions though, scorpions got bigger. Unfortunately, way bigger than you. The whole contient mutated into a huge conurbation of enormous scorpion nests: you are in the middle of it. In front of you is one of those scorpion nest.

The nest is swarming with "little" scorpions, as big as your head. Inside your head precisely, alongside your fear, your pragmatic common sense tells you something like "don't you think that this baby scorpion's tail could do a marvellous pen?"
