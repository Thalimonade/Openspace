Open Space
An Interactive Fiction by Thalie Schmidt, Laura Pippus, David Pavlik et Ludovic Rochat
Release 1 / Serial number 210602 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

The Office
Your boss and yourself are in the midst of stormy negotiations with new potential associates. The atmosphere is tense, so much so that you can feel sweat beads dripping down your tailored shirt as your sticky hands pound on your laptop keyboard. Your boss sits at your left while two other gentlemen sit straight across from you both. All of you have been in here, bargaining over contract terms, for quite a while now and you wrists are staring to ache as you write and erase what the others tell you to. The shadows you cast on the white office walls gently shift as the sun goes down,  you wish they had come up to an agreement by now.

 Suddenly, either out of weariness or out of boldness, one of your guests leans in towards you and suggests a daring idea. You see a spark light up everybody else's as the idea sinks a little deeper in all of your minds. 
 - This is great ..! says your boss.
 - This is illegal. you respond, completely astonished by the nature of such suggestions.
 - You're right, this can't appear on the records. Put that computer aside and grab a piece of paper! he adds. 

 You look around but can't seem to find any paper laying around. New ideas flood the room and you are not able the write any of them down. You painfully interrupt this flow of thoughts:  
 - Sir, I don't think we have any paper nor any pens. 
 The bubbly brainstorm turns into three heavy stares, the kind of stares that strip you from your will to disagree.
 - Would you be so kind as to go and fetch some for us ? asks the scarier of the two guest.
 - Yes, of course. you respond as you quickly get up.

Now out of your leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself: 
No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?
It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.
Going for a strawl could infact be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, even better, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

You can see a big door here.

Scientific Base Camp
Present of Antarctica. In the future, cars a flying and plants living peacefully with humans. The past is white, completely white and frozzen. Don't ask why, but from the south you can here gunshots and a hot breeze caresses your ears. North is hot too, but more primitive.

 The only thing you see beyond the camp's igloos is ice and extracted ice caps. You don't want to spend too much time here unless you always wanted to be a human ice cream. The igloos are scattered over a large area, but one is not far away. If you want to go inside, you'll have to crawl through the tunnel.

You can see a tunnel here.

Scorpion World
In the past is Mexico City. North and south seems to be far in the future; the first one is animated by iron and glass things flying through blue skies ans the second is filled with light and cashmachine sounds.

 Here you step into the future of Latin America. As time passed, a lot of species went extinct. Not scorpions though, scorpions got bigger. Unfortunately, way bigger than you. The whole contient mutated into a huge conurbation of enormous scorpion nests: you are in the middle of it. In front of you is one of those scorpion nest.

Futuristic Casino
In the past, Wuhan was here. You can't be sure, but in the north you might be seeing what looks like weird huge dinosaurs; nothing surprises you anymore... Not even the sanctuary that is in the opposite direction.

 But now, a milion colorful and blinking neon lights iluminate the corridors, and a pathway covered in a fluffy carpet leads you to the Black Jack table. A robot serves you a sparkling drink as the crowd gathered around Black Jack table cheers. You overhear a conversation and it seems like the winner gets a pistol, which could be very useful in opening doors... Since you are here, you might want to try your luck playing the Black Jack. 

You can see a Black Jack table (in which is a pistol) here.

In the future is Wuhan. In the north - deep in the distance - lays a huge brown and gold temple, could be in South America. If you turn you back to it, you can see another temple which looks more like a sanctuary, asian style.

 This workshop is A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these papers please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

Aztec temple
In the future is Mexico City.
The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

In the future is Wuhan. In the north - deep in the distance - lays a huge brown and gold temple, could be in South America. If you turn you back to it, you can see another temple which looks more like a sanctuary, asian style.

 This workshop is A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these papers please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

You can see an artisan here.

Maharaja's palace
In the future is the city center of New Delhi. From what you can see, south seems like a place in north europa when north looks more chinese. It is definitely difficult to understand the geography of this strange world. 

 The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree while attempting to steal whatever you're eating, as welll as magestic and colorful peacocks spreading their feathers into gorgeous fans. While ooking at one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

You can see a Peacock here.

New Delhi
In the future is Yogi's retreat and in the past is Maharaja's palace. To the north is a huge modern city.

 You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers during spring, birds are singing and market sellers seem to be singing out the prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuks, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones!

Mexico City
In the future is Scorpion's World and in the past is an Aztec Temple. If you look up north, all is frozen in the distance when in south everything seems be made of steal and concrete.

 Gunshots pierce the sky as you cross the road of today's Mexico. It is getting quite dark and you don't want any trouble, an unharmed guy like you should find a way out of hear. You see four similarly unwellcoming alleyways each leading in different directions: south, north, east and west.

You can see a cartel here.

Futuristic Casino
In the past, Wuhan was here. But now, a milion colorful and blinking neon lights iluminate the corridors, and a pathway covered in a fluffy carpet leads you to the Black Jack table. A robot serves you a sparkling drink as the crowd gathered around Black Jack table cheers. You overhear a conversation and it seems like the winner gets a pistol, which could be very useful in opening doors... Since you are here, you might want to try your luck playing the Black Jack.

office
- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

Shouldn't you bring back a pen?
You got the paper, but with what are the people supposed to sign with?

 Well well, dear player, the dimesions heard you and sent you quite far away. As you just entered a time and space traveling journey you ought to know that taking a strall to the east fast forwards you to the futur, the west brings you back to the past. As for north and south, they will change your location, letting you roam threw different continents.  

One has to be careful with what he wishes for nowadays... Wherever you land, you better find your way back to your meeting, fast, and with the correct supplies.

Aztec temple
In the future is Mexico City.
 The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

Chinese Workshop
In the future is Wuhan.
This workshop is A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

office
- No paper, no pens, is this really it? The office of the future?

Now out of your Leather chair, you take a last look at the conference table. You think to yourself:

It can't be. All it is, is a realm of shiny metals and cold greatings. Your buzzing laptop the stainless glass door, the cold coffee you drink, everything you lay your eyes on is chilling.

Going for a strawl could be exactly what you need. Suddenly, you catch yourself hoping for a paper shortage in the whole damn building or, better even, in the whole damn town. So you'd have an excuse to put some miles between you and this place.

Maharaja's palace
In the future is the city center of New Delhi. The imposing white marble palace is surrounded by the magnificent gardens of prince Abdul the second. Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree and try to steal whatever you're eating, and beautiful colorful peacocks that turn around. Looking one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

Chinese Workshop
In the future is Wuhan.
This workshop is A small and dusty room, with a little window that opens to a wide rice field. The air is tick and gloomy due to the arrival of the rain season. An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes made is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

Yogi's retreat
In the past is the city center of New Delhi. Now, it is the only community still standing in 20900"s India. This sanctuary is filled with trees, and in the network of streams that run around, you can see huge red, orange and white carps. Yoga matresses are pretty much everywhere, and the smell of the incense is just delightful. You feel a big sense of inner peace...

 if you stay here  for too long, you might not find the will to leave.

You can see a relaxing aura here.

        <result xml:space="preserve">You enter a comtemplative state of mind. 

Everything around you resonates in harmony as you crosse you legs and start to levitate. You no longer have any interest in the futilities of human civilisations. You rise above all this now and won't ever go back. 

Let this retreat host your eternal rest.

Scorpion World
In the past is Mexico City.
Here you step into the future of Latin America. As time passed, a lot of species went extinct. Not scorpions though, scorpions got bigger. Unfortunately, way bigger than you. The whole contient mutated into a huge conurbation of enormous scorpion nests: you are in the middle of it. In front of you is one of those scorpion nest.

Futuristic Casino
In the past, Wuhan was here. But now, a milion colorful and blinking neon lights iluminate the corridors, and a pathway covered in a fluffy carpet leads you to the Black Jack table. A robot serves you a sparkling drink as the crowd gathered around Black Jack table cheers. You overhear a conversation and it seems like the winner gets a pistol, which could be very useful in opening doors... Since you are here, you might want to try your luck playing the Black Jack. 

You can see a Black Jack table (in which is a pistol) here.

Wuhan
In the future is a Futuristic Casino and in the past is a Chinese Workshop.
A new, deadly virus was detected for the first time here. The city center is deserted, while the hospitals and morgues are filled with covid patients. You don't have a mask, you not even have a scarf to put around your mouth and nose... 

it might be better for you to leave Wuhan as fast as possible.

New Delhi
In the future is Yogi's retreat and in the past is Maharaja's palace. You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers during spring, birds are singing and market sellers seem to be singing out the prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuks, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones!

Yogi's retreat
In the past is the city center of New Delhi. Now, it is the only community still standing in 20900"s India. This sanctuary is filled with trees, and in the network of streams that run around, you can see huge red, orange and white carps. Yoga matresses are pretty much everywhere, and the smell of the incense is just delightful. You feel a big sense of inner peace... if you stay too long here, you might never leave.

If you look west, you can see the framework of a door in the distance. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office. There are poorly lit openings in the trees leading either to the north or the south. 

A big and modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. This door, however, looks more modern than the ones you have encoutered before, the knob has been replaced by a little blue screen, as if it was meant to be opened with some kind of beeper or pass.

 Well well, dear player, the dimesions heard you and sent you quite far away. As you just entered a time and space traveling journey you ought to know that taking a strall to the east fast forwards you to the futur, the west brings you back to the past. As for north and south, they will change your location, letting you roam threw different continents.  

One has to be careful with what he wishes for nowadays... Wherever you land, you better find your way back to your meeting, fast, and with the correct supplies.

Aztec temple
In the future is Mexico City.
The humming of a ritual chant bounces on the stone walls, you came right on time for the human sacrifice ! It seems like you landed in the past of Latin America and that the great Aztec civilization is at its peak.

A middle sized wall built in a strangely intelligent way with huge stones. It is too big for you to climb..

You can also see an Aztec Statue here.

An old artisan wearing a straw hat and loose hemp clothes is making rice paper at the back of the room. You slowly approach the man and, after bending towards in sign of respect, you ask him: - Sir, may I borrow one of these papers please? - Yes, of course, go ahead.

Multiple fountains provide fresh water for the animals that reside in the gardens: birds of all colors and sizes that sing from dawn till dusk, little monkeys that jump from tree to tree while attempting to steal whatever you're eating, as welll as magestic and colorful peacocks spreading their feathers into gorgeous fans. While ooking at one of the peacocks, you think to yourself: I bet I could use one of its feathers as a pen...

An old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed), a skinny jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

In south direction you can see something like ruins in the distance. On the opposite direction it seems like there is a temple or a sanctuary.

The air here is breezy. It is hard for you to move comfortably because your feet are plunged in water, or is it silt ? Vegetation is quite dense, reeds and weeds pave your way. If you look west, you can see the framework of a door in the distance. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office. There are poorly lit openings in the trees leading either to the north or the south. 

A big and modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. This door, however, looks more modern than the ones you have encoutered before, the knob has been replaced by a little blue screen, as if it was meant to be opened with some kind of beeper or pass.

You can also see an Aligator (on which is scaly skin) and a long wooden stick here.

Druid's tent

An old Celtic druid's tent, just like you imagined them. Drapy curtens frame passageways going north and south, they are too thick for you to see threw them. At the very back of the tent, behind all of the mess, you see a back door. Strangely enough, it looks like the one form your office 

The tent is cramped with peculiar shelves. They are made of thick lumber on which rests an army of glass jars filled with colorful liquids. Each jar is labeled with small srips of paper filled with a handwriting you can bearly decipher.

You can also see a small altar (on which are a rounded jar (closed) and pear shaped jar (closed)) and a cauldron here.

office
This place looks uncannily familiar. You can feel memories of calmer times resonate in your mind.  Is this where we came in?... Your boss is standing in a corner of the room and appears to be in a state of great agitation. Around the table, two obnoxious businessmen seem to have spend hours snorting cocaine. Talk to the boss.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones!

A big and modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive.

 Now, it is the only community still standing in 20900"s India. This sanctuary is filled with trees, and in the network of streams that run around, you can see huge red, orange and white carps.

New Delhi
In the future is Yogi's retreat and in the past is Maharaja's palace. You are now in the city center of New Dehli nowadays: your senses are flooded with all kinds of informations. The smells of a thousand spices assault your nostrils from a street market on your right hand and their colors fill up your soul like flowers during spring, birds are singing and market sellers seem to be singing out the prices of their marchandises; the whole thing is wrapped up in a whirlwind of scooters and tuktuks, adding a deeply human touch to the frenzy of the moment.

Somewhere in this exotic atmosphere, your eye catches a strange thing that doesn't seem to belong here: a modern glass door. You know, that opaque kind of glass which looks very expensive. Of course you'd know, your office has the same ones!

Ritual Waste
This place reminds you why you dont like BBQs: mostly because of the smell... While you are wondering why you got up here, your eyes are caught by what seems to be a human collarbone. It is strangely sharp, it almost look like a pen..

 Well well, dear player, the dimesions heard you and sent you quite far away. As you just entered a time and space traveling journey you ought to know that taking a strall to the east fast forwards you to the futur, the west brings you back to the past. As for north and south, they will change your location, letting you roam threw different continents.  

One has to be careful with what he wishes for nowadays... Wherever you land, you better find your way back to your meeting, fast, and with the correct supplies.

If you insist.

On the battlefield against the Corono Virus
The first that were touched by the disease, were the people of Wuhan
You were one of them.
